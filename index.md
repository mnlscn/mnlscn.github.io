# Welcome to My Website!

Hi, I’m **Manuel Scionti**, an AI Engineer and Data Scientist with a deep passion for leveraging the power of Artificial Intelligence to solve real-world challenges. My journey into AI began with a fascination for how machines can learn from data to revolutionize industries, streamline processes, and spark meaningful innovations.

Throughout my career, I’ve been hands-on in everything from building **machine learning models** to developing **autonomous agents** that help businesses operate more efficiently. I specialize in **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Generative AI**, where I’ve implemented solutions that bring data to life through **natural language processing**, **knowledge extraction**, and even **multimedia generation**.

At **Neodata Group**, I work on **cutting-edge AI systems** that drive intelligent automation. From creating **chatbots** to using **RAG architectures** for advanced data retrieval, I strive to turn unstructured data into actionable insights. My mission is to make AI scalable, efficient, and impactful, leveraging platforms like **Azure** to ensure that the solutions I build can grow alongside the organizations that use them.

Driven by curiosity and the thrill of continuous learning, I’m always on the lookout for new perspectives and challenges. Whether I’m exploring new AI algorithms or traveling the world to immerse myself in different cultures, I’m constantly seeking ways to grow and expand my understanding. Outside of work, I enjoy playing the drums, learning new languages, and experiencing the diversity of the world.

For me, **AI is more than just a tool—it’s a mindset**. It’s my way of exploring new possibilities, solving complex problems, and contributing to a future that’s smarter, more efficient, and full of potential.
